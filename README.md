# Powerlifting-Performance
Scraping Powerlifting Australia competition data from the past 21 years and analysing to find new insights, predict performance and determine winning strategies.

## To do
- Clean dataset using R/tidyverse

## Log
- Scraping data from site using Excel's Power Query, since the tables were exported from Excel so they are read by Excel naturally
- Need to download local copies of html files, and use them as Power Query data sources
- Cleaning should be easiest in R, so I'll export tabulized data to work with in R
- There are 38K rows and they're quite heavily varied prior to ~2010, so I might limit need to limit the scope
